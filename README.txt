It has been a while since I made my last XP project, So here's another one!

First, SettingXP is a Settings app for Windows XP. It doesn't replace the existing Settings app, but is rather used
as a simpler, and easier to understand version.

So lets get to the point.

To set it up, go to the "SettingXP.hta" file and click "Install raw file".

Now that you have it on your PC, if you are on XP as your OS (for whatever reason), Open the file and you are done!

If you are on a VM, just enable drag and drop if you didn't already and then drag and drop the file
and then you are done!
